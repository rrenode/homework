## Prompt:
 Given two integer numbers return their product only if the product is greater than 1000, else return their sum.

## Examples:

| number1 = 30      |   | number1 = 40     |   |   |
|-------------------|---|------------------|---|---|
| number2 = 30      |   | number2 = 30     |   |   |
|                   |   |                  |   |   |
| The result is 600 |   | The result is 70 |   |   |

## The Pseudocode:

given inputs: a and b

we want output = a x b if a x b > 1000
if not, then instead output = a + b
